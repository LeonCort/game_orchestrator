# Progress

## 1. What Works

*   Initial Memory Bank file structure has been set up.
*   Core documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been populated with initial information derived from the project brief.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High-Level Overview from `projectbrief.md`)

*   A functional Python application runnable from the command line.
*   Implementation of the **LLM Game Orchestrator Harness** (Gemini API calls, function call handling).
*   Implementation of **schemas and mock functions for at least 2-3 core tools**.
*   A basic **in-memory Simulated Game State Manager**.
*   A **CLI** (Typer/Click) for developer interaction.
*   Clear logging mechanisms.
*   Initial system prompt for the LLM Game Orchestrator.
*   Well-structured project with clear separation of concerns.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** Project Initialization and Planning.
*   **Overall Progress:** Just started. Foundational documentation (Memory Bank) is being established.

## 4. Known Issues

*   None at this very early stage.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   (To be populated as decisions are made or change throughout the project)
