# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

*   Project Initialization: Setting up the initial project structure, Memory Bank files, and preparing for the first development tasks.
*   Understanding Core Requirements: Digesting the `projectbrief.md` to ensure a clear understanding of goals and scope.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   Created the Memory Bank directory and populated initial versions of:
    *   `projectbrief.md` (copied from root)
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
    *   `activeContext.md` (this file)
    *   `progress.md`

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

*   Define the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and task plan.
*   Set up the Python project environment (Poetry, initial file structure for the application code).
*   Begin implementation of the first component, likely the Orchestrator Harness or basic CLI structure.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Confirming the choice of Poetry for dependency management.
*   Confirming Typer as the CLI framework.
*   Initial focus will be on the core loop: CLI input -> Orchestrator -> Gemini API (mocked/simple call initially) -> CLI output.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   Adherence to the Memory Bank structure and update process is critical.
*   Emphasis on modularity and clear separation of concerns as outlined in `systemPatterns.md`.
*   Detailed logging for observability.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
